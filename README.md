# Vehicle Management System

A simple console-based Vehicle Management System written in C. This project was built during my first year of computer science studies to demonstrate the fundamental concepts of C programming, including Structures, Arrays, and CRUD operations.

## Features

This system allows users to manage vehicle records efficiently through a command-line interface.

* **Authentication:** Secure login system with username and password.
* **Add Vehicle:** Add new vehicle details (ID, Name, Manufacturer, Date).
* **Search:** Search for specific vehicles by their name.
* **View All:** Display a list of all vehicles currently in the database.
* **Delete:** Remove vehicle records using their ID.
* **Update Credentials:** Change the admin username and password dynamically.

## Tech Stack

* **Language:** C
* **Concepts:** Structures, Loops, Strings, User Input Validation.

## How to Run

1.  Clone the repository:
    ```bash
    git clone [https://github.com/your-username/vehicle-management-system.git](https://github.com/ArmansHub/Vehicle-Manegement-System)
    ```
2.  Open the project in any C compiler (VS Code, Code::Blocks, or Dev C++).
3.  Compile and Run the `main.c` file.

> **Note:** This project uses `system("cls")` to clear the screen, so it is optimized for **Windows** operating systems.

##  Default Credentials

To access the system, use the following default credentials:

* **Username:** `arman`
* **Password:** `shakib`

*(You can change these after logging in from the menu option).*

## Future Improvements

* Implement File Handling to save data permanently.
* Migrate from `gets()` to `fgets()` for better security.
